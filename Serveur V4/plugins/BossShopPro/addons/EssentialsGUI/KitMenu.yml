## kitshopitem: 
## Here you can define the look and functionality of every kit icon.
## By default clicking and checking out the preview of a kit is free.
## The reward when clicking the icon is the preview-menu being opened.
## Besides the default configuration uses the '%kititem_1%' placeholder to make the icon look like the first item of the kit.
## That way icons look different and already give a preview of the actual kit.
