# About: Everyone knows plugins that allow you to have your group name
#		 in front of your name above your head. But this plugin does more then that
#        with over 180+ placeholders and more to come every update this plugin not only
#        allows placeholders in your name above your head but it also allows the name to
#        be animated.

# Permissions: To use the animatednames groups give them the permission
#              animatednames.group.<group>  (ex. animatednames.group.default)
#              Make sure to remove them from the other groupsd
#              when giving a new permission.
