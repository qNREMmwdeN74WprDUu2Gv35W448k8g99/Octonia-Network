# About: Everyone knows plugins that allow you to have your group name
#		 in front of your name above your head. But this plugin does more then that
#        with over 180+ placeholders and more to come every update this plugin not only
#        allows placeholders in your name above your head but it also allows the name to
#        be animated.

# Permissions: To use the animatednames groups give them the permission
#              animatednames.group.<group>  (ex. animatednames.group.default)
#              Make sure to remove them from the other groupsd
#              when giving a new permission.

tweaks:
  # Legacy mode. Disable this if you experience client crashes (bungeecord mostly)
  # Disabling will however use the build in scoreboard system what can cause conflicts
  # (White names, etc...)
  legacymode: false
  # If you have issues with non-legacy mode try this option. The option is more CPU intensive,
  # but it is meant to detect problems
  synchronized: false
  # Setting this to true will keep tab names untouched
  # Useful for those who do not want to change tab names but
  # only the names above.
  # NOTE: This shrinks the tab name by 2 chars
  # so if you have a long name it becomes shorter

# WARNING: The recommended interval for this plugin

#          You can experiment with lower ticks but this might
#          cause a slight flicker.


# AnimatedNames groups
# THESE ARE NOT PERMISSION GROUPS. THE NAMES DO NOT NEED TO MATCH
# YOUR PERMISSION GROUP.
# An AnimatedNames group is a group you assign to a player (or permission group)
# using animatednames.group.<GROUPNAME>
groups:
  default: # This is the default group. Add as many as you wish
    # Prefix in front of the player name above their head
    name-prefix:
      # A list to create animations
      text: # Text can be max 16 characters long (after placeholders are replaced)
      # {PREFIX} will be replaced with the PERMISSION prefix (Vault)
      # Meaning if your permission prefix is "[Mod]" it will show this
      - '{PREFIX}'
      # Animation interval in ticks (20 ticks = 1 sec)
      interval: 100
    # The display name above the player head (default {PLAYER})
    name-suffix:
      # A list to create animations
      text: # Text can be max 16 characters long (after placeholders are replaced)
      - '{SUFFIX}'
      # Animation interval in ticks (20 ticks = 1 sec)
      interval: 100
      
# Text below your name above your head
