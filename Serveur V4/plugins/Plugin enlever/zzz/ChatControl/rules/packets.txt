# This file manages special rules that can overlaps messages sent by other
# plugins or even the server, with the help of packets.
#
# You need ProtocolLib to enable this features.
# 
# This accepts only operators below:
#
# Valid operators:
# match <regex> (A valid regular expression to match the checked message.)
# then replace <message> (A word used to replace only the part of the matched message.)
# then rewrite <message> (A message used to replace the whole checked message.)
# then rewritein <world> <message> (A message used to replace the whole checked message in the specified world only. 
#                                   You can use this together with 'rewrite' as a fallback on other worlds. It is possible 
#                                   to add multiple operators in one rule for multiple worlds.)
# dont verbose (Even if you have Verbose enabled the rule will be hidden from appearing in the console.)
# then deny (Message will not be shown in the chat - cancels the packet.)
#
# For valid variables (e.g. %world) check out the header in the rules.txt file!
